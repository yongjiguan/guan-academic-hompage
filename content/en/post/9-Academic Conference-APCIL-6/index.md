## Graduation Photoes

Today, I receive my B.S. degree through my own efforts and qualified for a direct postgraduate study in [School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University](http://www.lzu.edu.cn/)!

In this happy day, I want to thank the teacher who answered my questions, the family who silently supported me, and all the friends and classmates who helped me.

My graduation photoes are shown as following:

- **Communication Engineering (Class I)**
