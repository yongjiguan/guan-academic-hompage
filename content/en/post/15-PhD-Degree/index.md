Today, I complet my PhD dissertation defense and then receive my PhD in [School of Information Science and Engineering, Lanzhou University](http://www.lzu.edu.cn/), China.

In this happy day, I want to thank the advisors (Prof. Xiaoping Zhang and Prof. Youquan Deng) who answered my questions, the family who silently supported me, and all the friends and classmates who helped me.
