title: Flow-Induced Energy Harvesting
event: Academic Conference
event_url: https://sites.google.com/site/apcil6homepage/home
location: Yonago Convention Center "BiG SHiP", Yonago city, Tottori, Japan.
summary: Talking about the mechanismof flow-induced voltage generation and the effect of channel size, graphene area and simulated temperature on flow-induced voltage.
abstract: "Herein, we employed MD simulation to investigate the generation of flow-induced voltage through driving ILs over graphene nano-channel. The flow-induced voltage can be potentially applied in nanoelectromechanical systems and offer much promise for bio-molecular sensing and bio-medical fields."
