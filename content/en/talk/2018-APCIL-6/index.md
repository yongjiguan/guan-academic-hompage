title: Flow-Induced Energy Harvesting
event: academia Theme Conference
event_url: https://sites.google.com/site/apcil6homepage/home
location: Yonago Convention Center "BiG SHiP", Yonago city, Tottori, Japan.
summary: Talking about the mechanismof flow-induced voltage generation and the effect of channel size, graphene area and simulated temperature on flow-induced voltage.
abstract: "Herein, we employed MD simulation to investigate the generation of flow-induced voltage through driving ILs over graphene nano-channel. The flow-induced voltage can be potentially applied in nanoelectromechanical systems and offer much promise for bio-molecular sensing and bio-medical fields."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using academia's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
