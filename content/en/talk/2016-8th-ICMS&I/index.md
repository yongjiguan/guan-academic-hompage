title: Nano-Wettability of Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Ionic Liquids
event: Academic Conference
event_url: http://icmsi.neotrident.com/
location: Grand Mercure Teda Hotel, Dalian, China
summary: Talking about the effect of droplet size, intrinsic viscosity and simulated temperature on Nano-Wettability of Hydrophilic and Hydrophobic Ionic Liquids.
abstract: "In the present work a series of hydrophilic and hydrophobic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been employed to probe the wettability in nano-scale using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The simulation results confirm droplet size, intrinsic viscosity and simulated temperature play the dominant role in the wettability of ionic liquids (ILs) in nano-scale."
