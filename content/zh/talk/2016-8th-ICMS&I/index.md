location: 中国大连泰达美爵酒店
summary: 报告液滴尺寸、本征黏度以及温度对亲疏水离子液体液滴在硅基底表面的润湿能力。
abstract: "In the present work a series of hydrophilic and hydrophobic 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have been employed to probe the wettability in nano-scale using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The simulation results confirm droplet size, intrinsic viscosity and simulated temperature play the dominant role in the wettability of ionic liquids (ILs) in nano-scale."
