abstract: Understanding dynamic change of ionic liquid (IL) THz spectrum under certain conditions is a real challenge. Herein, through spreading 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([Bmim][DCA]) nanodroplet on graphene surface, dynamic change of [Bmim][DCA] THz spectrum in the range from 30 to 300 cm$^{-1}$ is probed by computational calculation at 300 K. Analyzing the calculated THz spectra it can be found that vibrational bands at 49.95 (cation-anion bend), 216.45 cm$^{-1}$ (rocking of CH$_{3}$ in alkyl chain) show a 16.65 cm$^{-1}$ blue shift as spreading time increases from 0 to 5 ns and further blue-shift 16.65 cm$^{-1}$ as spreading time increases from 10 to 20 ns, while vibrational band at 266.40 cm$^{-1}$ (bend of CH$_{3}$ in methyl) only blue-shifts 16.65 cm$^{-1}$ as spreading time increases from 0 to 20 ns. The underlying mechanism is revealed to be the stronger adsorbed layer forming on graphene-IL interface which enhances the hydrogen bonds between cations and anions, and constrains the torsion and out-of-plane bend of CH$_{3}$ group in alkyl chain and methyl respectively. The findings described here represent an important step in developing a comprehensive understanding of dynamic manipulation IL THz spectrum by spreading IL nanodroplet on graphene surface.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Dynamic THz spectrum change of [Bmim][DCA] nanodroplet spreading on graphene surface in the range from 30 to 300 cm$^{-1}$ is probed by computational calculation at 300 K.
