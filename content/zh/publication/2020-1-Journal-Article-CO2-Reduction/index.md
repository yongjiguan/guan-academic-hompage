abstract: Nowadays, photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reduction of CO$_{2}$  represents a very promising solution for storing solar energy in value-added chemicals, but so far it has been hampered by the lack of highly efficient catalyst of photocathode. Enlightened by the Calvin cycle of plants, here we show that a series of three-dimensional C/N-doped heterojunctions of Zn$_{x}$:Co$_{y}$@Cu are successfully fabricated and applied as photocathodes in the PEC reduction of CO$_{2}$ to generate paraffin product. These materials integrate semiconductors of p-type Co$_{3}$O$_{4}$ and n-type ZnO on Cu foam to construct fine heterojunctions with multiple active sites, which result in excellent C-C coupling control in reduction of CO$_{2}$. The best catalyst of Zn$_{0.2}$:Co$_{1}$@Cu yields paraffin at a rate of 325 ug h$^{-1}$ under 0.4V versus saturated calomel electrode without H$_{2}$ release. The apparent quantum efficiency of PEC cell is up to 1.95%.
